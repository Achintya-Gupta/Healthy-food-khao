A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate food energy.

A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-plant source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.[4] Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.</p>

Obesity

One of the most common and perceivable effects of junk food is a rise in obesity in an individual. Junk foods are loaded with sugars, calories and fats that are a prime factor resulting in weight gain. Further, obesity is the starting point for issues that originate like diabetes, joint pain, and various heart ailments.

 
Learning and memory problems

High intake of sugars and fats tend to suppress the function of the brain that helps in learning and memory formation. This phenomenon is especially observed in growing children when their learning is at its highest. It was further supported by a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, where it observed junk food consumption led to poor cognitive test results. Results displayed in a sudden inflammation in the hippocampus region of the brain, which is responsible for your memory and recognition.

 
Loss of appetite and digestion

One of the bad effects of junk food is overeating. One may end up eating more than they require due to the fluctuation in their blood sugar levels. It makes the brain demand more food than the normal requirement. Further, there are problems in the digestion of such foods, which add up to the harmful effects of junk food consumption.
